This site was created to practice building a fullstack CRUD application. The site is designed to help sewing and quilting enthusiasts track what fabric is in their "stash", and what projects they have made from it.

This app uses a mongo db and express framework, with user authentication via passport and image uploading through cloudinary.


TO DO
- Give users the option of uploading a file or linking to a file on the internet
- Add this choice to projects as well as fabrics
- Give the option to link fabrics and projects (x fabric became y project)
- When user clicks on "Signed in as xyz" in top nav bar, take them to a profile page
- Still debating: allow users to upload multiple photos?
- Add flash error emssages instead of console logging
